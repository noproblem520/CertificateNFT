# CertificateNFT
One of my side projects. Due to high gas fee on Ethereum, I proposed using permissioned blockchain to implement. The platform sends learning points (ERC1155) to users based on their learning status, and users can exchange the learning points for NFT certificates according to the exchange requirements of each NFT certificate (ERC721).
